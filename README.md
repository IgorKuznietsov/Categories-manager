# Categories-manager
My first React Native application

'/client' directory contains source code of React Native part of the app
'/server' directory contains the web-server source code (Node.js), required for the application to work properly. MongoDB also should be installed at the server machine.

Authorization required. The demonstration user can be created via browser. Just follow the link http://localhost:3001/createDemoUser

The application provides an opportunity to create abstract 'categories' with hierarchical structure. The control buttons appear after a long press at the certain category. New categories can be added to the existing 'parent' one.  A category can be renamed or removed.

The application tested at the android cell phone with Expo app.

P.S.: Being my FIRST application it contains a lot of crutches and non-patern stuffs.
